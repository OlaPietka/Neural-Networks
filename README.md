# Neural Networks
## Description
In this project I implemented two neural networks to teach them addition. 

#### File neural_network1.py
Is simple network with two neurons on input layer, one hidden layer and output layer with one neuron (which is the output of the equation).

#### File neural_network2.py
Is more complicated network because of weights memorization, alfa parameter and additional neuron called bias.
